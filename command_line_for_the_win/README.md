This description outlines a unique and optional project focused on enhancing Bash skills through a game called _CMD CHALLENGE_. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the project, including its background, requirements, and submission guidelines:

### Project Overview

**CMD CHALLENGE**: A gamified platform designed to test and improve your command-line proficiency. The game presents a series of challenges that range from basic to complex tasks, all solvable using Bash command-line skills. As you progress, the tasks increase in difficulty, providing a comprehensive training ground for refining your shell scripting abilities.

### Participation Benefits

- **Optional Participation**: Engaging with this project is entirely voluntary. It's designed to be an additional activity for those interested in going beyond the curriculum to sharpen their command-line skills.
- **Incentive**: Completing any part of this project grants a bonus to your project grade, potentially pushing your overall average above 100%. It's a chance to enhance your grade while learning practical skills.
- **No Penalties**: Choosing not to participate won't negatively impact your current grades. However, if your project score surpasses your existing average, not participating could result in a lower overall average.

### Project Requirements

1. **README.md**: A crucial component of your submission is the `README.md` file. This file should be placed at the root of your project directory. It serves as a guide or an entry point for anyone reviewing your project, providing an overview of your work and achievements.

2. **Progress Tracking**: The CMD CHALLENGE platform visually indicates your progress by highlighting completed tasks in green. This visual cue helps you keep track of your achievements and remaining challenges.

3. **Submission Guidelines**:
   - **Screenshot**: To prove your completion of the required levels, you must take a screenshot that clearly shows the tasks you've completed.
   - **File Format**: Ensure that the screenshot is saved in a widely compatible format, either PNG or JPEG.
   - **GitHub**: Submit your screenshot by pushing it to GitHub. Make sure the file is named appropriately and uploaded to the correct repository and directory as specified by your project guidelines.

### Manual Review

- This project involves a manual review process. Your submission, including the `README.md` and the screenshot showing your completed levels, will be thoroughly evaluated by reviewers. The manual review ensures that your achievements are accurately assessed and credited.

Transferring Task Files Using SFTP
This section outlines the process for securely transferring specific task files from your local environment to our project's remote server using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol). Follow these instructions to upload the files corresponding to the completed tasks in the alx-system_engineering-devops repository, under the command_line_for_the_win directory.

Task Files to Transfer
0. First 九 tasks - Upload 0-first_9_tasks.jpg and 0-first_9_tasks.png.
1. Reach חי completed tasks - Upload 1-next_9_tasks.jpg and 1-next_9_tasks.png.
2. Reach the perfect cube, 27 - Upload 2-next_9_tasks.jpg and 2-next_9_tasks.png.
Prerequisites
SSH access to the a7ba27855981.dd0356c3.alx-cod.online server.
SFTP command-line tool installed on your local machine.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Connect to the Server
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, and initiate an SFTP session:

bash
Copy code
sftp a7ba27855981@a7ba27855981.dd0356c3.alx-cod.online
Enter your password when prompted to establish the connection.

2. Navigate to Your Local Directory
Before starting the SFTP session, ensure you're in the directory containing the task files:

bash
Copy code
cd C:\alx-system_engineering-devops\command_line_for_the_win
3. Upload Task Files
For each task, use the put command to upload the files to the appropriate directory on the server. Ensure you replace /remote/target/path with the actual path on the server where the files should be stored.

0. First 九 tasks:

bash
Copy code
put 0-first_9_tasks.jpg /remote/target/path/0-first_9_tasks.jpg
put 0-first_9_tasks.png /remote/target/path/0-first_9_tasks.png
1. Reach חי completed tasks:

bash
Copy code
put 1-next_9_tasks.jpg /remote/target/path/1-next_9_tasks.jpg
put 1-next_9_tasks.png /remote/target/path/1-next_9_tasks.png
2. Reach the perfect cube, 27:

bash
Copy code
put 2-next_9_tasks.jpg /remote/target/path/2-next_9_tasks.jpg
put 2-next_9_tasks.png /remote/target/path/2-next_9_tasks.png
4. Verify Uploads
After uploading each file, use the ls command to list the files in the remote directory and confirm that your uploads were successful.

5. Exiting the SFTP Session
To end your SFTP session, simply type:

bash
Copy code
exit
Additional Tips
Double-check the file names and paths before uploading to avoid errors.
Use quotes around file paths with spaces or special characters when using Command Prompt or PowerShell.
By following these detailed steps, you'll ensure that the files corresponding to the completed tasks are securely and accurately transferred to our project server a7ba27855981.dd0356c3.alx-cod.online. This guide is designed to facilitate the file transfer process for contributors working on the alx-system_engineering-devops project, specifically within the command_line_for_the_win directory.


### Conclusion

This project offers a fun and engaging way to improve your command-line skills. It's an opportunity to learn at your own pace, challenge yourself, and potentially boost your grades. Whether you're a beginner looking to get comfortable with the command line or an experienced user aiming to test your skills, CMD CHALLENGE provides a platform for growth and learning.
